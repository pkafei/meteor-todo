## ToDo Meteor Application

### What: 

A simple "hello world" meteor application based on [meteor's official tutorial]


### Why:

I want to create [Dapp applications] so I'm learning more about [Solidity application development]. Key tools for creating Solidity blockchain applications [like mist], are built using Meteor. 


### How Long:

Took me two hours to build, but keep in mind this is a very bare-bones app

### What Did You Learn:

Meteor took me a short amount of time to become productive in this framework. Some of the highlights of this framework include the ease of turning your web application into a mobile application by simply using commands like `meteor add-platform ios` or `meteor add-platform android`. And finally, meteor is just a pleasant framework to work with.


### ToDo:

* create user accounts
